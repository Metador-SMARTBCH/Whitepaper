# What is Metador?  
Metador is a virtual gaming project, which the main gameplay is set up around mining, combating as well as collecting resources, engaging in virtual actions with the default currency as Metador. Leveraging blockchain technology, assets in the game are issued as non-fungible tokens and can be transferred and traded freely in the in-game marketplace. The in-game transactions are all recorded on the blockchain to ensure that there is no centralized party that could tamper the game results and other actions.
